# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

## Project Description

Sk8Spots is a web application that stores and displays your wish-list of skateboarding spots from around the globe.  Each spot will have an image (or more) of the terrain, a text-location, (stretch: a map image,) and a brief description or notes section.   Sk8Spots can also store and display the spots that you have already skated at, so that you can keep track of your progress, store your photos from these spots, and keep notes about your experiences.


## Problem Statement

If you like to skateboard and like to experience different terrain or need an array of different spots depending on what you are working on, you need to have a place to keep all of this and save brain space.  There's a lot of asphalt and concrete out there, and it's hard to remember it all:  all the spots, the addresses, what the spots have to offer.


## How will your project solve this problem?

Sk8Spots can simplify all this for you.  It offers a central place to store your wish-list of spots you'd like to visit and all the relevant information about them.  Furthermore, besides just acting as a repository of spots you'd love to visit, Sk8Spots also catalogues the spots you've already visited and their relevant info.
